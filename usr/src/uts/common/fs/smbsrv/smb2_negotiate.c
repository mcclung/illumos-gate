 * with setsockopt SO_SNDBUF, SO_RCVBUF.  These set the TCP window size.
 * This is also used as a "sanity limit" for internal send/reply message
 * allocations.  Note that with compounding SMB2 messages may contain
 * multiple requests/responses.  This size should be large enough for
 * at least a few SMB2 requests, and at least 2X smb2_max_rwsize.

 * smb2_max_rwsize is what we put in the SMB2 negotiate response to tell
 * the client the largest read and write request size we'll support.
 * For now, we're using contiguous allocations, so keep this at 64KB
 * so that (even with message overhead) allocations stay below 128KB,
 * avoiding kmem_alloc -> page_create_va thrashing.
